Terminal Notes: Git-Powered Temporal Notes That Never Forget
Never lose a note again.
 Terminal Notes transforms Git into a temporal database for your 
knowledge, tracking every item with UUIDs across renames, moves, and 
deletions. Search across all time, resurrect deleted items with full 
context, and navigate instantly through infinite hierarchies.
🚀 Why This Exists
Every
 knowledge worker loses data. Git can't track items across renames. 
Version history loses context. Navigation gets confusing. Terminal Notes
 solves all these problems simultaneously by making Git understand items, not just files.
🔥 Breakthrough Features
🔍 Full Item Resurrection: Search and restore anything ever deleted, with original notebook hierarchy
🕰️ Modeless Time Travel: Browse past versions in same interface—no "history mode" switching
⌨️ Instant Navigation: [1]Home/[2]Projects/[3]Code/ → type J2 to jump anywhere instantly
💾 Unified Notes & Files: 41 programming languages with templates + regular notes in one system
📊 Temporal Database: Git as lightweight temporal DB with UUID tracking across all operations
🧠 Built Differently
Created
 in 30 days by a non-programmer using AI assistance. Solves 3 unsolved 
problems in version control and temporal databases. Proof that 
innovation comes from fresh perspectives.
🛠️ Quick Start
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terminal-notes
cd terminal-notes
python terminal_notes_ui.py
✨ What You Get
Zero data loss: Everything preserved in Git with UUID tracking
Keyboard-first: Entire app controllable with single keystrokes
Progressive learning: Features appear when relevant, no overwhelm
Research-grade: Implements temporal database theory practically
